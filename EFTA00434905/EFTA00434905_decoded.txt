Ike,

 

If you have the ability to scan and email them that will be great, might
make it easier on you.  Then you can pop the hard copies into the regular
mail.

 

Whatever works best for you

 

 

thanks

Mr. Groff,

 

Just wanted to let you know I have not yet seen the paperwork referenced
below.  We still have two and a half weeks until May 1st subscriptions, but
I wanted to give you a quick "heads up", as I am on vacation next week, and
I am closing the office for the week.  It's been a long tax & audit season,
and next week is the school vacation for everyone's children, and my staff
all deserve a break.  I will be able to check my emails nightly and respond,
I'm taking my daughter to look at colleges - four schools, four states, four
days.  So I will be driving a lot, and not able to check emails mid-day, but
I will check in every evening, and get back to you should you need me.

 

I am leaving at 2pm on Friday 4/15/11 and I will be back in the office on
4/25/11. Please shoot me an email if you need me, and I will get back as
quickly as possible.

 

Thanks very much.

 

Chris

Dear Ike,

 

We are in the process of confirming subscription requests for May 1st. I
believe that you had indicated that you would like to invest $250,000. It
would greatly help our capital planning if you could please confirm this.
Concurrent with your addition, if you could please fill out the fund
subscription documents (included as an attachment) and return it to our
administrator, Chris O'Neill (copied on this email), that would be great.
Her contact information is:

Please let me know if you would prefer not to invest in the fund as there
are several other people we have asked to wait that could invest sooner
should you not wish to invest.

 

Thank you,

Nathaniel
